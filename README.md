# Wend1
This is a chatbot designed to help you create patches for the software synthesizer serum.
This app runs on the open ai framework via streamlab, langchain, and the OpenAI framework.
In order to engage this model, please provide specific descriptive terms of the sound you are looking for to the chatbot.
  >Please format your input as "generate a [descriptors] sound"
    >No additional context should be needed, and Wendy will generate a list of relevant parameter values
    (If you want to use another software synthesizer, simply add that context at the end of your prompt
      for example"generate a [descriptors] sound for the sofware synthesizer 'dexed' will generate dexed parameters)
      If no additional context is provided Wendy will generate parameters for "Serum" by default.
This bot is named Wend1 after Wendy Carlos, the inventor of the modern synthesizer.
